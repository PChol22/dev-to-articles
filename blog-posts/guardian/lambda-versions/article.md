# Let's keep track

Lambda versioning is great and might come in handy, but do you really need to keep dozens of outdated copies of your functions' code ? Here are two reasons why you should get rid of them.

## 1. Less is more

It sure can help to have a backup version of your code to rollback to in case of an emergency, but the day it happens, you will feel a lot more comfortable only having to chose between two or three documented, aliased versions than being overwhelmed by dozens of anonymous and forgotten ones.

## 2. Beware of AWS Lambda quotas

AWS Lambda enforces a regional [75 GB limit][quotas] for all your uploaded packages. This threshold might seem hard to reach and harmless, but it takes into account every version of every Lambda you have deployed: dozens of versions per function multiplied by a large bundle size (see our [previous article][guardian-bundle-size-article]) will take you to over this threshold in no time.

It is possible to raise this soft limit by contacting the support, but it's not a sustainable workaround, and you don't want to be stuck unable to upload your new version when there's an important fix to deploy.

# Easily monitor your Lambdas versioning with Guardian üõ°Ô∏è

[Guardian][guardian] now offers a **new rule** preventing your lambdas versions counter from going crazy.

Guardian also comes with **many other rules** to help you make the best decisions for your Serverless project. It will help you identify where your deployed resources can be optimized to achieve better performance at a lower cost.

# Guardian how-to

```
npm install @kumo-by-theodo/guardian
npx guardian -p <your_aws_profile> -c <your_stack_name>
```

Guardian is available on [NPM][npm-registry]. You will find instructions to use Guardian in your CI.

There also many other tools helping you manage your Lambdas versioning. One of them is [Serverless Prune Plugin][serverless-prune-plugin], which integrates with the Serverless Framework and allows you to only keep a certain amount of recent versions for each of your functions.
